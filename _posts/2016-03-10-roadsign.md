My cycling route to office takes me on a gentle downhill through Shotwell. A quiet tree lined street with a school,
a dance theatre, a long time corner pub, a bag shop, a small hand held movie production house, yoga studio and so many other hidden gems. I chanced upon this auto mechanic and saw this road sign. I cycled two blocks past and figured I might never see this again, cycled back and a took a photo of this. Neat souvenir huh?
