Water was found on Mars today. News sites took great pains to point out that it is liquid running
water flowing down canyons and craters during the summer months. Summer temperatures can go up to 35
celcius even in the shade (though the average high is a much colder 20 celcius). So if water were to
exists, it might just flow! Though scientists have long observed presence of water(water that
existed in the past) this is the first time we see evidence of running water (actually happening).
The money line is <i> “These results confirm the hypothesis that RSL are due to present-day activity of briny water. “</i>

What does this mean for us? Well with water, might <i>just possibly</i> come life? We have seen
evidence of life here on earth in the deepest of oceans, sulphur springs, icy tundra with  no light
and   temperature extremes. So why not on Mars? And where does this leave us in the Universe? That we
are not unique? That we are an accident? Keep in mind some estimates place 100 million life
supporting planets in our galaxy alone and maybe 60 <i>billion</i> across the universe.
</br>
Humanity would not be the stretch of life. Life extends all over the universe. How will religious
thinkers and philosphers think about facets we attribute to humankind? e.g. morality,
compassion,empathy, self awareness? Are they too created in His likeness?

<p>
The future is very exciting.

The pictures were taken with the very capable Moto X Pure. The camera takes reasonably sharp pictures with a pleasant 
color rendition. Though the auto HDR works it can easily make skins look burnt. But overall the feature works well. The pictures 
were treated in VSCO.
