<p>
I had a roll of Ilford HP5 120 format film to finish and I decided to use the
Plaubel to finish it with. I'm not entirely on board with the 6x7 format; it
doesn't seem wide enough and actually works better in the portrait format. The
Nikkor 40mm equivalent lens is tad too wide for portraits - you'd need to come
in closer. My brother was visiting and I took 3 photos in front of the adorable
Bay Bridge (no idea why i use that adjective for a bridge). Overexposed by
nearly 3 stops, yet lovely contrast and bokeh. The grain on a medium format is
always so delicate to behold. 
<br> Once again, i recall how i enjoy the rangefinder for it's distraction free
experience

<p> Changing gears, while cycling home from office, I came across a derelict
church that happened to be for sale. Cordoned off with imposing wire fences, the
urban desolation of a once busy place of congregation excited my underdeveloped
law breaking self. After a few moments of hesitation, I tossed my bag through
the narrow gap and swung myself inside. I felt free behind those chained fences
and tried to document, 120 style, the end of place that was once a place to gather.
</p>


<p> I've never been comfortable with religion. Maybe it was a reaction to the
ever present religious fervor in India, or everything which I wanted explained
was attribute to God's way by my parents. I grew up scorning religion and the
people who had faith, regarding their faith a crutch for their limited capacity
to think and fear. Places of congregation were symbols of this limited
thinking. As I grew older, I was witness to religious inspired violence,shame
and control. I never quite understood why people would explain away a flood as
the mysterious ways of an omnipotent God. Or that these were tests a God put
in Man's way. Not that all religions subscribed to the same idea, but others
seemed to have other illogical claims on our lives. But with experience and
illuminating discussions with friends, i learned to separate Religion from the
people who practice it. And the role it can play in a our lives. That as humans
we are finite and sometimes it gives us strength that a being, beyond the
circumference of human finiteness, exists and loves us. Thus one can be
religious and yet still love other sects and minorities and not wish hell fire
on non believers. The concept of a crutch has been relegated to my rigid youth. So
moving on from a place were I treated churches and temples as places for the
hate and strife inducing people to congregate, I now see it as a place for
people to gather in a place, that, in its ideal, is dedicated to providing hope
and helping ones
fellow neighbors close and far.  </p> <p> And  with a sigh, it too is for sale.  </p>
